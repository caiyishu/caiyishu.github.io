By examining the strategies employed by politically active firms to navigate social scrutiny and sustain political rents, we offer a framework that enhances understanding of the interactions among civil society, private sectors, and governments.

We underscore the critical role of **business groups in leveraging internal coordination to maintain their advantages**, even in the face of increasing transparency and societal scrutiny.

We suggest that **transparency reforms could unintentionally create new asymmetries in political access** and that corporate political activities may generate externalities. Politically active business groups, being better positioned to benefit from political engagement, may capture rents relinquished by standalone firms.

We highlight a broader concern: **social movement for transparency alone may be insufficient to dismantle entrenched systems. Rather than eliminating rent-seeking, transparency may instead reshape it—enabling more covert or sophisticated strategies that continue to serve elite interests.**

We offer **a gendered, demand-side perspective** to explain the gender gap in corporate campaign donations.

We suggest that **female politicians show more reservations in accepting or seeking corporate donations due to social gender role expectations**, and this gap is further amplified for candidates with political family backgrounds.

However, we also find that strong social trust in business-political relations, fostered by a positive corporate social image, can help mitigate this gap.

We highlight that **even political elites, often perceived as powerful and independent, are not immune to deep-rooted gender biases. These biases shape their resource acquisition strategies and reinforce systemic inequalities in political markets.**

How can Larry Ellison, characterized as high in neuroticism by *Harvard Business Review* (Maccoby, 2004), so dramatically contradict himself regarding cloud computing?

We propose that the risks and opportunities unfolding along technological trajectories interact with psychological mechanisms to drive corporate engagement.

Specifically, high-neuroticism CEOs demonstrate heightened threat sensitivity and negative affective biases, steering their reactions depending on environmental stimuli, while trait anxiety amplifies their responses, driving extreme behavioral outcomes.

**Turning point events significantly reshape environmental stimuli by shifting technological perceptions from ambiguous unknown domains to structured known domains, leading high-neuroticism CEOs to exhibit contrasting behaviors toward breakthrough innovation.** We test this theory in the context of AI innovation, using AlphaGo’s victory as a turning point event.

Our findings underscore that radical technological change is influenced not only by technological factors but profoundly by influential social events and managerial psychological characteristics. Thus, **a deeper examination of psychological mechanisms within their social contexts is essential to understanding corporate engagement with technological changes.**

Do competitors’ offline stores help or hinder online retail performance?

Analyzing transaction data from a major O2O platform in Hong Kong, we find that **the opening of competitors’ offline stores increases online sales among the platform’s existing customers**, driven by their search for broader choices and better prices online. **The opening of competitors’ offline stores  also reduce product returns in the O2O platform** by enabling customers to evaluate items before purchasing online.

However, **the opening of competitors’ offline stores negatively impacts new-customer acquisition, posing growth challenges for online retailers.**

Our findings not only provide strategic insights for retailers but also illuminate broader implications for understanding consumer behavior and **the evolving nature of market dynamics** in an increasingly integrated retail environment.
